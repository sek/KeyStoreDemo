# KeyStoreDemo

This app isn't intended to run on a phone, but rather just the KeyStoreTest JUnit test contains some tests demonstrating Android Keystore functionality
See: https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html

Specifically this app demos what can be done with API Level 19. Additional functionality is added in API Levels 21 and 23

For an app that makes similar use of the Keystore, and does have a UI, see:
